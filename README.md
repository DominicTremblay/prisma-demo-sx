# Creating an API with Prisma

Welcome to our Prisma and Express demo! By building a small movie API, we will demonstrate the amazing capabilities of Prisma, a modern database toolkit, and Express, a well-known Node.js framework. This demonstration will show how Prisma and Express may be used to streamline and simplify your backend development process. Let's explore the Prisma and Express worlds and unlok the full potential of creating modern APIs!

In the demo, we will be doing:

## 1. Introduction to Prisma and its benefits for building APIs

 - Brief overview of Prisma and how it simplifies database management
 - Explanation of how Prisma can be used to generate a CRUD API quickly

## 2. Setting up a new Prisma project

 - Installing Prisma and initializing a new project
 - Configuring the Prisma schema file and connecting to a database

## 3. Creating the movie model and CRUD operations

 - Defining the movie schema with necessary fields (e.g. title, release date, director)
 - Generating Prisma client code and using it to perform CRUD operations on the movie model

# Implementation

You can actually build the demo from scratch by following the [steps guide](./steps.md).
